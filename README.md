## About The Project

This repo is a personal project to display some of my coding skills as a Frontend Engineer. This is a work in progress piece and I will also use it to experiment new technologies or new things I want to try and test. Current status is a version 0.0.1, so right now, it's to early to jump into conclusions. I have a passion for tourisim and travel which I used as an inspiration here, maybe in the future this may become an interesing tool use by many people.
